##Simple Linear Regression With commmon data and with visualizing images

#for code use linearreg.py file 

learn basics about coefficient and intercept  

i hope you may know the Equation for the Siple Linear Regression 

y= ax+b

y= dependent variable(predcit variable)
a= intercept
x= feature
b= coeff_
